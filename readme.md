# Cooley-Tukey algorithm implementation

Code written by [tado-mi](https://www.github.com/tado-mi) in March, 2019.

Following is an implementation of the Fast Fourier Transformation using the [Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooley%E2%80%93Tukey_FFT_algorithm), in Python, as a code test for an internship at [Ligero](https://ligero-inc.com/). It is a work in progress, both in terms of possible further optimisations, and debugging.
